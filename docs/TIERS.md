## FAQ

### General

**Why use Lex instead of JSON/Lua directly?**
Write once, compile to any engine. Change engine? Recompile. No manual translation. Your `.lex` file is the single source of truth.

**Why not just use a spreadsheet?**
Spreadsheets lack: type validation, references, visibility filtering, code generation, version control. Lex gives you all of that.

**Is Lex only for games?**
Primarily, but works for any declarative data: configs, content management, API schemas.

**What if my engine isn't supported?**
- Free: `lua`, `json` work everywhere
- Core: more engines coming
- Custom: implement the `Backend` interface (C++)

Or [request a backend](https://github.com/David-Imperium/Lex-compiler/issues).

### Licensing

**Can I use Lex commercially?**
Yes! MIT license allows any use — personal, commercial, open source.

**Does every team member need a license?**
Yes, each developer needs their own license. Contact for team pricing (5+ seats).

**Does lifetime license expire?**
Never. Pay once, use forever. Including all future updates.

**Do I need internet to use Lex?**
No. Lex works completely offline. License verification is local.

**Can I get a refund?**
Yes, 30-day money-back guarantee. No questions asked.
